"Calcium Carbonate
(CaCO3)",Chalk,"105 ppm
Ca+2
158 ppm CO3-2",1.8,Raises pH,Because of its limited solubility it is only effective when added directly to the mash. Use for making dark beers in areas of soft water. Use nomograph and monitor the mash pH with pH test papers to determine how much to add.
"Calcium Sulfate
(CaSO4*2 H2O)",Gypsum,"61.5 ppm
Ca+2
147.4 ppm
SO4-2",4,Lowers pH,"Useful for adding calcium if the water is low in sulfate. Can be used to add sulfate ""crispness"" to the hop bitterness."
"Calcium Chloride
(CaCl2*2H2O)",,"72 ppm
Ca+2
127 ppm
Cl-1",3.4,Lowers pH,Useful for adding Calcium if the water is low in chlorides.
"Magnesium Sulfate
(MgSO4*7H2O)",Epsom Salt,"26 ppm
Mg+2
103 ppm
SO4-2",4.5,Lowers pH by a small amount.,"Can be used to add sulfate ""crispness"" to the hop bitterness."
"Sodium Bicarbonate
(NaHCO3)",Baking Soda,"75 ppm
Na+1
191 ppm
HCO3-",4.4,Raises pH by adding alkalinity.,"If your pH is too low and/or has low residual alkalinity, then you can add alkalinity. See procedure for calcium carbonate."
